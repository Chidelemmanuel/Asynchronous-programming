Asynchronous-programming
Definition of Terms
Synchronous programming is known as a blocking architecture and is ideal for programming reactive systems. As a single-thread model, it follows a strict set of sequences, which means that operations are performed one at a time, in perfect order. While one operation is being performed, other operations’ instructions are blocked. The completion of the first task triggers the next, and so on.
Example: Think of a telephone conversation. While one person speaks, the other listens. When the first person finishes, the second tends to respond immediately.
Asynchronous programming is a multi-threaded model that’s most applicable to networking and communications. Asynchronous is a non-blocking architecture, which means it doesn’t block further execution while one or more operations are in progress.
Example: Low-code app development. In a low-code platform, multiple developers can work on projects at the same time, which helps accelerate the process of delivering apps.

Async Functions with async/await
Async/Await is a feature that allows you to write asynchronous code in a more synchronous, readable way.

    •  Async is a keyword that is used to declare a function as asynchronous.
    •  Await is a keyword that is used inside an async function to pause the execution of the function until a promise is resolved.

The differences between asynchronous and synchronous include:
       
      1. Async is multi-thread, which means operations or programs can run in parallel. 
      2. Sync is single-thread, so only one operation or program will run at a time.
      3. Async is non-blocking, which means it will send multiple requests to a server. 	
         Sync is blocking — it will only send the server one request at a time and 	will wait for that request to be answered by the server.
      4. Async increases throughput because multiple operations can run at the same time. Sync is slower and more methodical.
      
  Differences aside, asynchronous and synchronous methods both offer advantages, but for different stakeholders: 
      
      Async for users and sync for developers.

Asynchronous programming enhances a user’s experience by decreasing the lag time between when a function is called and when the value of that function is returned. In the real world, this translates to a faster, more seamless flow.
For example, users want their apps to run fast, but it takes time to fetch data from an application programming interface (API). In these cases, asynchronous programming helps the app screen load faster, improving the user experience.

Synchronous programming, on the other hand, is advantageous for developers. Quite simply, synchronous programming is much easier to code. It’s well supported among all programming languages, and as the default programming method, developers don’t have to spend time learning something new that could open the door to bugs.

How to choose between asynchronous and synchronous programming

When deciding which approach to take, it may be helpful to think of asynchronous programming as adaptable, and synchronous programming as strict. Asynchronous programming is the multi-tasker, moving from one to-do to the other and alerting the system when each one is complete. 
Synchronous programming functions as a one-track mind, checking off one task at a time in a rigid sequence.

Asynchronous programming allows more things to be done at the same time and is typically used to enhance the user experience by providing an effortless, quick-loading flow.
Synchronous programming is best utilized in reactive systems. While it is simpler for developers to code and is recognized by every programming language, sync is resource-intensive and can slow things down.


IN CONCLUSION
Synchronous Programming is define when the execution of operations is done sequentially. An operation will only be executed after the previous one is done. This means that a potentially complex task may take a while before all it’s steps are executed and completed.

Asynchronous programming is a way for a computer program to handle multiple tasks simultaneously rather than executing them one after the other. It’s an essential concept in JavaScript that allows your code to run in the background without blocking the execution of other code.
